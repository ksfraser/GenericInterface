# Ksfraser\GenericInterface Documentation

## Use Case Requirements
- Provide a reusable trait for  model classes to standardize property access, mutation, and validation.
- Allow model classes to override validation logic for specific fields.
- Support integration with schema/descriptor-driven validation in the future.

## Business Requirements
- Enable consistent data validation across multiple business modules.
- Reduce code duplication for property management in model classes.
- Facilitate migration to modern, testable, and maintainable code.

## Functional Requirements
- Trait must provide set(), get(), arr2obj(), and insert_data() methods.
- set() must call validate_field() before setting a property.
- validate_field() must be overridable in the consuming class.
- Throw exceptions on validation failure or invalid property access.

## Architectural Requirements
- PSR-4 autoloading for Composer compatibility.
- All code under src/Ksfraser/GenericInterface/.
- Unit tests under tests/.
- Documentation under docs/.

## Test Plan
- Unit tests for set(), get(), arr2obj(), and validation logic.
- Tests for both successful and failed validation.
- Tests for property existence enforcement.
